The Waves 2010 Website

This was a website designed and developed to be viewed on university campus networks.
Which means we expected trouble; blocked SWFs, slow speeds, the usual campus crunch.
And this was a cultural festival website; going with all-out minimalism would impress
a few geeks viewing the page on Lynx; not good when we're looking at drawing massive
participation from the "young and hip" across the nation.

We hope this serves as a valuable find for those trying to make the best of their
restricted resources and still create something beautiful and functional.
